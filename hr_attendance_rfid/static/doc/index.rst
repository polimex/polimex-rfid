- A bullet list item
- Second item

  - A sub item

- Spacing between items creates separate lists

- Third item

1) An enumerated list item

2) Second item

   a) Sub item that goes on at length and thus needs
      to be wrapped. Note the indentation that must
      match the beginning of the text, not the
      enumerator.

      i) List items can even include

         paragraph breaks.

3) Third item

#) Another enumerated list item

#) Second item
